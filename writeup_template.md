### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 7 steps. Starting with the following image:

![solidWhiteCurve](/Users/brizo/Documents/workspace/car-nd/CarND-LaneLines-P1/test_images/solidWhiteCurve.jpg)



1. I normalized the colors of the image so that I can reduce the effects of shadows and highlights.  You can see this in the image below.

2. I convert the image to grayscale

3. I do a gaussian blur on the grayscale image to remove artifacts and false edges

4. Run a canny edge detection algorithm using an auto thresholding algorithm based on median threshold.  This algorith calculates the median value of the image then, given a sigma value, calculates the low threshold that is sigma below the median and a high threshold that is sigma above the median.

5. A polygon fill is created to mask out the unwanted parts of the image.  I calculated the vertices based on ratios of the screen.  I am assuming that the camera is fixed where the horizon crosses through the middle of the frame and when the car is inside a set of lanes the left and right lanes are equally centered.  

6. I then run the `HoughLinesP` algorithm that takes the points from the Canny Edge Detector and computes lane lines.

7. The line is then overlayed onto the original image to show accuracy.

   â€‹

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by classifying  each line generated by the Hough Transform as either LEFT, RIGHT, or OTHER. This classification is done by looking at the slope of the line and position on screen.  If the slope is positive and between a lower and upper bound, then the line is on the right side.  If it is negative within similar lower and upper bounds, it belongs to the left lane.  Otherwise we consider it noise.  The reason for the flipped signs is because the image origin starts from the top left.  Once the left and right lines are classified, I use `np.polyfit` on the points for the left lane to get the best fit line and repeat for the right lane.  I then draw a line from the bottom of the screen to the top of the region of interest.
